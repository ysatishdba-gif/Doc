As an ODE clinical intelligence system,

I want to leverage a CUI summarizing method to assess the information retention capacity of each CUI. This will enable the team to select CUIs that encompass the most information from other related CUIs. For instance, 'Pain in left arm' should be prioritized over 'Arm Pain.' Currently, our search method might prioritize 'Arm Pain' because its constituent terms ('arm' and 'pain') are more broadly supported. However, from an information retention perspective, 'Pain in left arm' clearly retains more specific contextual information.

I want to assess how much meaningful information each detected CUI retains from the user’s narrative within a single clinical intent,
so that downstream components can understand the relative completeness of each concept before any prioritization or ranking is applied.

This assessment evaluates whether a CUI meaningfully captures the core health concern expressed by the user, considering specificity, qualifiers (e.g., anatomical site, laterality), and alignment with the narrative—without making decisions about which CUI should be preferred.

Dev Notes:


Input:
A set of CUIs
Their detected locations
A context_string
Output: 
A sorted list of the input CUIs
Information-retention related scores. 
For each CUI in the sorted list, an accompanying set of other CUIs whose information is explained or retained by that CUI.
