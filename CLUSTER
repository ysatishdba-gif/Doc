Building upon our existing capability to distill document-extracted CUIs into a concise, representative set, this user story addresses the next phase of summarization. The current refined CUI set, though comprehensive and potentially distinct from Nature Breakdown API results, can still contain multiple items. The goal is to implement a topic model to categorize this refined set of CUIs into standard, predefined topics, thereby providing a higher-level summary for matching with user search query.

Dev Notes
(Later) Once we know associated CUIs, we would work on creating another cluster set representing the Topics.


AC: A topic model is implemented to group the refined representative CUIs into predefined standard topics.

Each refined CUI is mapped to:

One primary topic, and

Optional secondary topic(s) if confidence thresholds allow.

Topic definitions and mappings are driven by a configurable reference (not hard-coded).

The output includes:

Topic name/ID

Associated CUI list

Confidence score per topic

Topic modeling works independently of, but is compatible with, Nature Breakdown API outputs.

Results are consumable by downstream search and matching workflows.

System logs include:

CUIs processed

Topics assigned

Confidence scores

Unit tests validate:

Deterministic topic assignment for known CUI sets

Graceful handling of CUIs with no strong topic match

Documentation updated describing:

Topic model approach

Topic definitions

Integration points with search and summarization
