Building upon our existing capability to distill document-extracted CUIs into a concise, representative set, this user story addresses the next phase of summarization. The current refined CUI set, though comprehensive and potentially distinct from Nature Breakdown API results, can still contain multiple items. The goal is to implement a topic model to categorize this refined set of CUIs into standard, predefined topics, thereby providing a higher-level summary for matching with user search query.

Dev Notes
(Later) Once we know associated CUIs, we would work on creating another cluster set representing the Topics.


AC: Information completeness is evaluated per CUI within a single detected clinical intent.
Each CUI is assigned a completeness score or classification based on how well it reflects the user’s narrative.

Completeness assessment considers:

Presence of clinically meaningful qualifiers (e.g., anatomy, laterality, severity, timing).

Alignment with the primary health concern described in the text.

Qualifiers (e.g., laterality) contribute to completeness only when explicitly supported by the user’s narrative.

No CUIs are filtered or ranked in this step; all detected CUIs are retained.

The output exposes completeness metadata for each CUI for downstream consumption.

Completeness assessment logic is intent-scoped and does not compare CUIs across different intents.
