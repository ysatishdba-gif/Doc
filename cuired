Description: Our team has deployed a Nature Breakdown model, accessible via an API. Currently, the output format is explicitly defined within the prompt. This user story aims to establish and enforce a standardized output format from the API, which is crucial for guaranteeing consistent data structures for downstream consumption and processes.

Acceptance Criteria:A standardized output schema is defined for the Nature Breakdown API.

The API consistently returns output conforming to the standardized structure, independent of prompt wording.

Output schema includes, at minimum:

Nature category

Sub-nature (if applicable)

Associated CUIs or identifiers (if available)

Confidence score

Source text reference or chunk ID

LLM-based chunk tagging or structural enforcement is implemented to ensure schema compliance.

Schema validation is applied before returning the API response.

Backward compatibility is maintained or a versioned API output is provided.

Downstream consumers are able to rely on the standardized structure without custom parsing logic.

Unit tests verify:

Consistent output structure across varied input texts

Proper handling of partial or ambiguous nature breakdowns

Documentation (README, wiki page) updated with:

Output schema definition

Example responses

Versioning and migration guidance

Versioning is incremented in API Capabilities table

API is deployed to AIF
