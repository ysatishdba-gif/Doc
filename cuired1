The current Nature Breakdown Intent Extraction mode is overly restrictive and rejects valid, clinically relevant requests that are meta, analytical, or workflow-oriented in nature (for example, requests to extract clinical entities, classify clinical information, or summarize document content).

This user story enhances the existing Intent Extraction API prompt to accept and generate intents for general, non-patient-specific concepts that fall within the scope of clinical knowledge, while continuing to reject content that is entirely non-clinical.

The goal is to improve usability and alignment with real downstream use cases—such as document analysis, entity extraction, and clinical workflow support—without compromising clinical relevance boundaries.


AC: A topic model is implemented to group the refined representative CUIs into predefined standard topics.

Each refined CUI is mapped to:

One primary topic, and

Optional secondary topic(s) if confidence thresholds allow.

Topic definitions and mappings are driven by a configurable reference (not hard-coded).

The output includes:

Topic name/ID

Associated CUI list

Confidence score per topic

Topic modeling works independently of, but is compatible with, Nature Breakdown API outputs.

Results are consumable by downstream search and matching workflows.

System logs include:

CUIs processed

Topics assigned

Confidence scores

Unit tests validate:

Deterministic topic assignment for known CUI sets

Graceful handling of CUIs with no strong topic match

Documentation updated describing:

Topic model approach

Topic definitions

Integration points with search and summarization
