Our team previously developed a model designed to analyze user-provided queries, identifying their core intents and associated sub-natures. This story proposes extending that functionality to include contextual information regarding potential answers and their locations. This "environmental information" will serve to confirm the existence and relevance of the intent-specific data. The overall objective is to furnish a comprehensive perspective that aids in validating discovered answers and provides guidance for other search capabilities.

The story focuses on:
Identifying which facets of contextual information should be considered
Determining whether facets of contextual information can be systematically or automatically identified
To illustrate a broad conceptualization of our goal—distinct from an exact list of outcomes or specific contextual elements—consider the following example:

An intent is "Glioblastoma Diagnosis History". One might consider various categories where information to satisfy this intent could be found, such as:

An intent is "Glioblastoma Diagnosis History"
One may think of where information to satisfy this intent can be found, like:
Medical Records and Clinical Documentation
Patient Intake Forms/Medical History
Consultation Notes (Neurology, Oncology, Neurosurgery, Radiation Oncology)
Oncology Treatment Plans/Summaries
Pathology Reports
Imaging Reports
Referral Letters
Scientific Research Protocols and Papers
Clinical Trial Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria
Observational Studies/Registries
Epidemiological Research
Retrospective Chart Reviews
Medical Legal and Insurance Documentation
Disability Claims
Life Insurance/Health Insurance Applications
Medical Malpractice Cases
Expert Witness Reports
Grant Proposals
Medical Teaching and Case Presentations
Case Studies/Grand Rounds
Or, it can be about subjects, like:
Patient
Diagnostic Team
Treatment and management team
Researcher
Administrative, legal, and support personnel
Or, it can be about time, like:
Past six year time window
Time of initial diagnosis
Period of initial treatment
Subsequent follow-up and surveillance for recurrence
Management of neurological deficits or treatment-related complications
This contextual information is intended to confirm the environment in which answers to intents are found. It's crucial because while information might superficially appear applicable as quickly stated text, it would be considered irrelevant if its broader contextual environment does not align with the intent's true meaning or scope.

IMPORTANT: It is important to differentiate this outcome from the natures and sub-natures that our current model provides. As illustrated in the example, this contextual information is distinct from the natures or sub-natures identified within searched or expanded queries. Instead, it represents the approximate contextual environment that models can leverage to frame the search effectively. 

Dev Notes:
This story is a spike focusing on (1) and (2) mentioned above.
Logic created in this story won't be final, but to explore different possibilities and potentials.
The findings will be reported in the Capability Sync-up..


AC  :A clear distinction is documented between:

Intent / sub-nature outputs

Contextual environment indicators (this spike’s focus)

A candidate list of contextual facets is identified and categorized, such as:

Document types / sources (e.g., pathology report, consult note)

Actor or subject roles (e.g., patient, clinician, researcher)

Temporal scope (e.g., diagnosis period, follow-up window)

For each contextual facet, the spike evaluates:

Whether it can be systematically inferred (rules, metadata, structure)

Whether it requires model-based inference (LLM, embeddings)

Whether it is out of scope or non-viable

At least 2–3 representative intents are used as examples (e.g., diagnosis history, treatment history) to demonstrate:

Possible contextual environments

How context helps validate or invalidate candidate answers

Prototype or pseudo-logic is created showing:

How contextual indicators could be attached to an intent

How they might guide or constrain downstream search

Findings include:

What contextual signals are most valuable

What signals are unreliable or noisy

Risks of confusing context with nature/sub-nature

No production logic is required; outcomes are exploratory only.

Results are documented and shared in the Capability Sync-up, including:

Key insights

Example mappings

Recommendations for future implementation stories
